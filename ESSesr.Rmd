# Introduction {#introduction}

### About this report
This Ecosystem Summary Report supports DFO's efforts to incorporate ecosystem approaches into Fisheries Science and Resource Management in the Maritimes Region. The purpose of this report is to synthesize ecosystem information to inform an ecosystem approach, as highlighted in the modernized Fisheries Act ([2019; Bill C-68](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C68E)). It aligns objectives broadly to those of the [Maritimes Ecosystem Based Management Framework](https://sites.google.com/view/ebminitiative/ebm-initiative-home), and regional/area-based objectives that contribute to Scientific Advice and Management Plans or other Harvest Strategies. The aim of this Ecosystem Summary Report is to provide an integrative suite of ecosystem indicators relevant to a specific fisheries management area that can support DFO's Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management ([EAFM](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/initiatives/ecosystems-approach-approche-ecosystemique/index-eng.html)) and Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management ([EBFM](https://sites.google.com/view/maritimesebfmwg/home)).


### Report structure
This report outlines ecosystem objectives related to a specific management area (Table 1), and reviews relevant ecosystem indicator trends and the status of the most recent year(s) relative to a reference point (if available) or a long-term average. The results are synthesized to outline potential implications for the management area examined. Where relevant this document provides links to reports and resources for details and methodology. This report summarizes general ecosystem trends to support integration of ecosystem information and expertise into Science Advice (e.g. stock assessment) or Resource Management (e.g. Integrated Fisheries Management Plans), but is intended for a variety of users.

This is a summary of the best available information describing the ecosystem specific to the management areas within the Maritimes Region.

# A. Pressures and Stressors {#pressuresandstressors}

## Climate and oceanography 
The ESS area is strongly influenced by natural variability of the climate system (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation) and, therefore, long-term monitoring is needed to determine how anthropogenic climate change is affecting ocean temperatures. The NAO index has been mostly positive for the last decade, which favours warm, salty conditions ([Petrie 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3137/ao.450302)). 


### North Atlantic Oscillation Index
[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 2.1)

Climatological mean is shown as the dashed green line. Solid lines are ± standard deviation (SD)."}

```

- In 2023, the winter (December–March) North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index was below the 1991 – 2020 mean, –0.31 (–0.84 SD). A high NAO index corresponds to an intensification of the pressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Strong northwest winds, cold air and sea temperatures, and heavy ice in the Labrador Sea and on the NL shelf areas, are usually associated with a high positive NAO index ([Colbourne et al. 1994](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E-Colbourne-2/publication/281064239_Climatic_changes_and_environmental_conditions_in_the_Northwest_Atlantic_1970-1993/links/55d31fc508aec1b0429f2dee/Climatic-changes-and-environmental-conditions-in-the-Northwest-Atlantic-1970-1993.pdf); Drinkwater 1996). The opposite response occurs during years with a negative NAO index.

- The NAO has been shown to strongly affect bottom temperature distributions throughout the region from the Labrador Shelf to the Gulf of Maine ([Petrie 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3137/ao.450302)). The response is bimodal, the product of direct and advective effects, with positive (negative) NAO generally corresponding to colder- (warmer-) than-normal bottom temperatures over the Labrador-Newfoundland Shelf, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Eastern Scotian Shelf, and warmer- (colder-) than-normal conditions on the Central and Western Scotian Shelf and in the Gulf of Maine.

```

- The annual SST anomalies during 2023 were higher than average and SST remained above normal, with the last three years being the three warmest years in the ESS. A regime shift algorithm to detect a step change using mean levels was applied to the annual time-series (Rodionov 2004). Over the length of the record, the temperature has three distinct periods at all regions, a relatively cooler period from 1982 to 1993, near the climatological mean from 1994 to 2011, and a relatively warmer period from 2012 to present.


### Bottom Temperature Anomaly

- The near-bottom temperature anomalies for 2023 showed a decreasing trends across NAFO 4Vn, 4Vs, and 4W areas. While the northern part of the ESS (NAFO 4Vn) is in a warmer bottom temperature regime since 2012, The southeast portion of the ESS (NAFO 4Vs) is in the normal range in 2022-2023.  On southwest portion of the ESS (NAFO 4W) bottom temperatures were showing cooling trends below normal for 2023. All regions show elevated bottom temperatures since approximately year 2010.

```
- Over the past two decades, the Scotian Shelf has incurred rapid warming due to the increased dominance of Warm Slope Water. 
- SST in the ESS area between 2016-2020 is within the reference period mean (1991-2020), indicating average sea temperatures in the ESS over recent years. However bottom temperature in ESS has generally remained higher than average. 

### Dissolved Oxygen, stratification, salinity
```{r, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 14, fig.pos='H',fig.cap="Dissolved oxygen (mmol/L) from winkler bottle measurements for the ESS. Stratification and salinity (ppt) for the ESS from 1970-2018. Dashed lines denote the long-term mean, solid lines denote ."}

  select(YEAR, Salinity)

  psal<-plot_indicator(Salinity, YEAR, Salinity, y_label="Salinity (ppt)") 

po2 + pstrat + psal + plot_layout(nrow=2, byrow=FALSE)

```
- Direct measurement for dissolved oxygen (DO) from Winkler bottle measures indicate that dissolved oxygen for the late winter (February) were high (6.4 mmol/L) in the ESS, but within normal range. Measures of DO for from 2022 were taken from a late survey that occurred in the Fall (October) and could account for the lower readings.
- Salinity and stratification have been generally higher, with more years above the longterm mean in the ESS since the early 1990s. In later years (2018), both were slightly below the longterm mean, but within a normal range. These trends are consistent with SST trends for the ESS 

## Longer-term climate change 

Ocean model long-term forecast and projections provide a general expectation of how the world may change. Ocean model projections use low and high emissions pathways as future scenarios to frame expectations of the future ocean climate.

```{r longtermclimate,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 8, out.width="80%",fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Future scenarios for sea surface temperature changes."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "SSPs_2040P_change_annual.png"))
```

- In the ESS by 2050, the onset of spring is expected to occur 3-4 weeks earlier than present day and the growing season is expected to last 4-6 weeks longer ([Brickman & Shackell, 2024](https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/12/1/00001/203135)) 

- Projected changes in sea surface temperature (2040-2059 relative to present day) for the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine range from approximately 1.5 to 2.5°C (based on IPCC scenarios SSP2-4.5 to SSP5-8.5) ([Wang et al, 2024](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07055900.2023.2264832)).  

- With a rapidly changing ocean, we can expect shifts in productivity and distribution in the ESS, as well as shifts in the seasonal timing of their reproductive cycles.

- By 2100, under both low and high emissions scenario, most marine species across the Canadian portion of the NW Atlantic are from moderate to high climate risk, and indeed, are at a lower risk compared to many areas around the globe, especially tropical ecosystems. While the NW Atlantic is warming rapidly, the resident species are, on average, widespread across the seascape, and are accustomed to a wider range of temperatures ([Boyce et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-024-00067-5)). 

- However, formerly commercial but now depleted species will be at much greater risk due to their low population sizes  ([Boyce et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-024-00067-5), see Fig 5 for list).

### Fishing Pressure
[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions, see Table S5 for species categories)

This indicator measures the level of exploitation or total fishing pressure at the ecosystem level (Landings/Biomass). Change in this indicator can result from change in biomass, landings or both. 

```{r ,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Fishing pressure from 1970-2020 calculated from DFO Summer Research Vessel survey. Data have been corrected for catchability with the exception of invertebrates. Dashed lines denote long-term means, solid green lines denote ± stanard deviation (SD) from the available timeseries. Purple, shaded areas represent the latest 5 years of available, robust data."}

dat.dir<-here::here("data")
eco_indicators<- "eco_indicators_esswss.Rdata"
  load(file.path(dat.dir, eco_indicators))
  
eco_indicators<-allIndicators #might be a marindicators relic that names it all Indicators
  
#filter relevant data sets
fp_all<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR,FP_ALL)

fp_forage<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR, FP_FORAGE)

fp_gadoids<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR, FP_GADOIDS)

fp_inv<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR,FP_INVERTEBRATES) #filter weird FP_invert value for 2021=166 all biomass estimates are low so filtered 2021 out


pa1<-plot_indicator(fp_all, YEAR, FP_ALL, y_label="All Fishing Pressure")

pa2<-plot_indicator(fp_forage, YEAR, FP_FORAGE, y_label="Forage Fishing Pressure")
  
pa3<-plot_indicator(fp_gadoids, YEAR, FP_GADOIDS, y_label="Gadoid Fishing Pressure")

pa4<-plot_indicator(fp_inv, YEAR, FP_INVERTEBRATES, y_label="Invertebrate Fishging Pressure")
 

(pa1|pa2)/(pa3|pa4)

```

- The latest robust estimates of overall fishing pressure in the ESS (2020) has been below the long-term average since around 1995. The 2018 fishing pressure is artificially high due to the lack of Summer Research Vessel survey in the ESS for that year, while landings remained stable.

- Fishing pressure on gadoids and forage fish in the ESS have been below the long term mean since the 1990s. In contrast, fishing pressure on invertebrates has been close to the long term average in recent years.


### Commercial Landings
[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions, see Table S5 for species categories)

pb4<-plot_indicator(land_gad, YEAR, landings_GADOIDS.L, y_label="Gadoid landings (kg)")

      
(pb1/pb2/pb3/pb4)

```

- With the exception of invertebrates, commercial fisheries landings are decreasing over the last 5 years. 

- Commercial fisheries landings for forage fish and gadoids have generally been below the long-term average since the 2000s. Invertebrates landings have been increasing over time, but have been in declining over the last 5 years (but still above it's long-term mean). These trends coincide with shifting availability of species in the area.

Productivity relates to the amount of energy or biomass generated in an ecosystem, providing energy to consumers. 

### Nitrate, Chlorophyll, Bloom stats, *Calanus finmarchicus*,  Zooplankton Biomass
[Casault et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-6-3589-eng.pdf)

A number of factors play a role in primary and secondary production. The amount of available nutrient supply for phytoplankton production is represented by surface (0-50 m) and subsurface (50-150 m) nutrient concentrations

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height=10,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Nitrate 0-50m, Nitrate 50-150, from Louisburg Line (LL), Chlorophyll (surface) from the Eastern Scotian Shelf.

```
- Although recent warming would suggest a shift to higher nutrient concentrations across the Scotian Shelf (SS) region, recent evaluation of the long-term trends in nutrient availability across the SS has actually shown a decrease in nutrient availability since 2010, the onset of this warming period.

- In the most recent year, surface Chlorophyll in the ESS has been high.

- The most recent estimates in NAFO 4V of biomass of *C. finmarchicus* has been lower than the long-term average in 2023, while abundances in NAFO 4W are average. 
- Most recent estimates of zooplankton biomass has average in NAFO 4V, but below the longeterm average in NAFO 4W since 2022.

### Large Fish Indicator (LFI)

[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions and details)

LFI is an estimate of the proportion of large fish in the community or proportion of biomass occupying the top predator trophic-level ([Greenstreet and Rogers 2006](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/63/4/573/690519#139793319)). 

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 5, fig.height=4,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Large fish indicator from RV survey data that has been corrected for catchability. Dashed lines represent the mean, solid green lines denote ± stanard deviation (SD). Purple, shaded areas are the latest 5 years of available data."}
dat.dir<-here::here("data")
eco_indicators<- "eco_indicators_esswss.Rdata"
  load(file.path(dat.dir, eco_indicators))
  
  eco_indicators<-allIndicators #might be a marindicators relic that names it all Indicators
  
LFI<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR, LargeFishIndicator)

  
pLFI<-MAReco::plot_indicator(LFI, YEAR, LargeFishIndicator, y_label="Large Fish Indicator")

(pLFI)
```
- LFI in the ESS area has varied over time across two periods pre and post the mid 1990s. Latest four years indicate that LFI is below the long-term mean and indicate that structure and functioning of the ESS ecosystem may be unbalanced with a lower proportion of large fish to small fish in the ecological community.

## Biodiversity 
Biodiversity is described as the variety and variability among living organisms from all sources ([CBD](https://www.cbd.int/convention)). It is linked to ecosystem resilience and plays an important role in maintaining functionality and productivity of ecosystems. Biodiversity can relate to genetic, species, guild and ecosystem diversity. 

### Shannon Diversity Index, Margalef Richness, Heip's Evenness
[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4)

Shannon Diversity Index accounts for both abundance and evenness of species present in a community. Margalef Richness measures the number of species present accounting for sampling effects. Heips Evenness measures how equally the species richness contributes to the total abundance or biomass of the community. Due to improvements in species identification over time, long-term Shannon Diversity and Margalef richness can be misleading. Only years 2000-2020 were used here. 

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height=7,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Shannon diversity Index, Margalef Richness, Hieps Evenness measured from data collected from DFO's Summer RV survey and has been corrected for catchability.Dashed lines represent the mean, solid green lines denote ± stanard deviation (SD). Purple, shaded areas are the latest 5 years of available data."}

dat.dir<-here::here("data")
eco_indicators<- "eco_indicators_esswss.Rdata"
  load(file.path(dat.dir, eco_indicators))
  
  eco_indicators<-allIndicators #might be a marindicators relic that names it all Indicators
  
 Shannondiversity<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021 & YEAR>2000)%>%
        select(YEAR, ShannonDiversity_ALL)
 
 Heips<-eco_indicators %>%
  filter(ID=="ESS",YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR, Heips_ALL)
 
  Margalef<-eco_indicators%>%
  filter(ID=="ESS", YEAR<2021 & YEAR>2000)%>%
        select(YEAR, MargalefRichness_ALL)

  
  pj1<-plot_indicator(Shannondiversity, YEAR, ShannonDiversity_ALL, y_label="Shannon Diversity")
  
  pj2<-plot_indicator(Heips, YEAR, Heips_ALL, y_label="Heips") 


  pj3<-plot_indicator(Margalef, YEAR, MargalefRichness_ALL, y_label= "Margalef Richness") 

  
(pj1|pj3)/(pj2)
  
```
 
- Biodversity measures through time in the ESS indicate that the ESS is currently generally composed of fewer dominant species. While improving sampling protocols in the RV surveys have increased Margalef Richness over the last 5 years, the species diversity has been lower (lower mean range) in the last 5 years. Heips evenness has been relatively low since the 2000s, the low values (<0.2) is consistent with a community with generally fewer, species that are highly abundant. 

### Guild-level Biomass

[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions, see Table S5 for species categories)

Guild-level biomasses address structural attributes of food webs, and can also serve as proxies for ecosystem functioning ([Tam et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/74/7/2040/2970046)).This indicator includes multiple guilds for fish and invertebrates from the RV Survey.

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height=7,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Total Biomass and guild-level biomasses for fish catagories from DFO's Summer RV survey which have been corrected for catchability.

  pi1<-plot_multiple_indicators(bio_ind, YEAR, value, name, y_label = "Biomass (t)", legend_labels = c("All", "Forage", "Gadoids", "Inverts"))
 
  pi2<-plot_indicator(bio_inv, YEAR, BIOMASS_INVERTEBRATES, y_label= "Invertebrate Biomass (t)") 
  
  pi3<-plot_indicator(bio_for, YEAR, BIOMASS_FORAGE, y_label= "Forage Fish Biomass (t)") 
    
    pi4<-plot_indicator(bio_gad, YEAR, BIOMASS_GADOIDS, y_label= "Gadoid Biomass (t)") 
      
(pi1)/(pi2|pi3|pi4)
  
```
- Low values in 2018 are due to lack of RV survey data for the ESS. Generally, due to low catchability of invertebrates in the RV survey, they are likely underestimated, but trends are considered reliable.

- Total biomass of all commercial fish species combined are generally decreasing over the last 5 years, with both invertebrates and forage fish experiencing decreases in the most recent year. 

- Gadoid biomass has varied around the long term mean since the 1970s, however have been generally decreasing since 2014. 

- Forage fish have been declining over the last 5 year period and below the long-term mean. Biomass of forage fish is the lowest since the beginning of Summer RV survey records.

### Landed value (CAD) by species catagory

This is the landed value of groups of species for the ESS region. Exploration of this data was based on published overviews of Canadian [Seafisheries landings](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/stats/commercial/sea-maritimes-eng.htm).

```

- Historical trends indicate that groundfish had higher landed value in the 1990s than mollusc and crustaceans or pelagic and estuarial fish in the ESS, but recent landings are dominated by Mollusc and crustaceans. This was due to availability and market interests at the time. 
- In the last 5 years, the landed value of mollusc and crustaceans in the ESS have fluctuated while still remaining high. Although conservation concerns for many invertebrate species is low, variability in landed value could have impacts to coastal communities. In contrast, recent 5 year landed values of groundfish and pelagic groups have remained stable in the ESS.
